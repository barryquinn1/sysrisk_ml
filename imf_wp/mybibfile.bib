  abstract  = "Abstract Many researchers use unit fixed effects regression
               models as their default methods for causal inference with
               longitudinal data. We show that the ability of these models to
               adjust for unobserved time-invariant confounders comes at the
               expense of dynamic causal relationships, which are permitted
               under an alternative selection-on-observables approach. Using
               the nonparametric directed acyclic graph, we highlight two key
               causal identification assumptions of unit fixed effects models:
               Past treatments do not directly influence current outcome, and
               past outcomes do not affect current treatment. Furthermore, we
               introduce a new nonparametric matching framework that elucidates
               how various unit fixed effects models implicitly compare treated
               and control observations to draw causal inference. By
               establishing the equivalence between matching and weighted unit
               fixed effects estimators, this framework enables a diverse set
               of identification strategies to adjust for unobservables in the
               absence of dynamic causal relationships between treatment and
               outcome variables. We illustrate the proposed methodology

              characterizing endogenous selection bias and of understanding its
              consequences (Hern{\'a}n et al. 2004). We use causal graphs
              (direct acyclic graphs, or DAGs) to highlight that endogenous
              selection bias stems from conditioning (e.g., controlling,
              stratifying, or selecting) on a so-called collider variable,
              i.e., a variable that is itself caused by two other variables,
              one that is (or is associated with) the treatment and another
              that is (or is associated with) the outcome. Endogenous selection
              bias can result from direct conditioning on the outcome variable,
              a post-outcome variable, a post-treatment variable, and even a
              pre-treatment variable. We highlight the difference between

              been widely understood in practice. Using a simple
              pretest-posttest design in a linear setting, this paper
              translates the conventional algebraic formalization of FE and RE
              models into causal graphs and provides intuitively accessible
              graphical explanations about their data-generating and
              bias-removing processes. The proposed causal graphs highlight
              that FE and RE models consider different data-generating models.
              RE models presume a data-generating model that is identical to a
              randomized controlled trial, while FE models allow for unobserved
              time-invariant treatment-outcome confounding. Augmenting regular
              causal graphs that describe data-generating processes by adding
              the computational structures of FE and RE estimators, the paper
              visualizes how FE estimators (gain score and deviation score
              estimators) and RE estimators (quasi-deviation score estimators)
              offset unmeasured confounding bias. In contrast to standard
              regression or matching estimators that reduce confounding bias by
              blocking non-causal paths via conditioning, FE and RE estimators
              offset confounding bias by deliberately creating new non-causal
              paths and associations of opposite sign. Though FE and RE
              estimators are similar in their bias-offsetting mechanisms, the

               concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications
               in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics,
               philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social

               manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to
               causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the
               relationships between causal connections and statistical
               associations. The book will open the way for including causal
               analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial
               intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and
               economics. Students in these fields will find natural models,
               simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical
               definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have
               evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of
               Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that
               causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer
               science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000
               scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists
               from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this
               revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers
               readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent
               advances in this field of research. Causality will be of
               interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of
               fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships
               from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess

               infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression

               response in a synthetic control that would have occurred had no
               intervention taken place. In contrast to classical
               difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it
               possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable
               impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a
               fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate

              that could lead to spurious causal inferences. However, our
              approach to these biases has been muddled at times by dealing
              with each bias separately and by confusion about the sources of
              bias and how to mitigate them. This paper shows how the
              methodology of directed acyclical graphs (DAGs) formulated by
              Pearl (2009) and particularly the concept of collider bias can
              provide economic historians with a unified approach to managing a

               intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and
               economics. Students in these fields will find natural models,
               simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical
               definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have
               evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of
               Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that
               causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer
               science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000
               scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists
               from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this
               revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers
               readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent
               advances in this field of research. Causality will be of
               interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of
               fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships
               from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess
               explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal
               understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating
               and invaluable.",

@ARTICLE{Schneider2020,
  title    = "Collider bias in economic history research",
  author   = "Schneider, Eric B",
  abstract = "Economic historians have long been aware of many forms of bias
              that could lead to spurious causal inferences. However, our
              approach to these biases has been muddled at times by dealing
              with each bias separately and by confusion about the sources of
              bias and how to mitigate them. This paper shows how the
              methodology of directed acyclical graphs (DAGs) formulated by
              Pearl (2009) and particularly the concept of collider bias can
              provide economic historians with a unified approach to managing a
              wide range of biases that can distort causal inference. I present
              ten examples of collider bias drawn from economic history
              research, focussing mainly on examples where the authors were
              able to overcome or mitigate the bias. Thus, the paper addresses
              how to diagnose collider bias and also strategies for managing
              it. The paper also shows that quasi-random experimental designs
              are rarely able to overcome collider bias. Although all of these
              biases were understood by economic historians before,
              conceptualising them as collider bias will improve economic
              historians' understanding of the limitations of particular
              sources and help us develop better research designs in the

               provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary
               econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By
               focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content,
               the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while
               emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear
               and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or
               individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation
               frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum
               likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered
               in detail, including probit and logit models and their

               include a broader class of models for missing data problems;

               for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of ``generalized

              measures. The aggregation accordingly takes into account the

               control over managerial behavior. We develop theory to explain
               variation in the responses of firms to such pressures, i.e., why
               some firms acquiesce by actually implementing stock repurchase
               programs, while others decouple formally adopted repurchase
               programs from actual corporate investments, so that the plans
               remain more symbolic than substantive. Results of a longitudinal
               study of stock repurchase programs over a six-year time period
               show that decoupling is more likely to occur when top executives
               have power over boards to avoid institutional pressures for
               change and when social structural or experiential factors
               enhance awareness among powerful actors of the potential for
               organizational decoupling. The study has implications for future

                   frequently observed and increase the probability of large

                   estimation tool for evaluating the Conditional Value-at-Risk

               micro-prudential objectives. The database coverage is broad,
               spanning 64 countries, and with quarterly data for the period
               2000Q1 through 2014Q4. The five types of prudential instruments
               in the database are: capital buffers, interbank exposure limits,
               concentration limits, loan to value (LTV) ratio limits, and
               reserve requirements. A total of nine prudential tools are
               constructed since some useful further decompositions are
               presented, with capital buffers divided into four subindices:
               general capital requirements, real state credit specific capital
               buffers, consumer credit specific capital buffers, and other

              ongoing concern for both research and practice, in order to avoid
              deviant behavior and its consequences. However, the way
              compliance with regulations is actually enacted or ``performed''
              within organizations instead of merely executed, remains largely
              under-characterized. Evidence from an ethnographic study in the
              compliance unit of a French investment bank allows us to develop
              a detailed practice approach to how regulation is actually
              implemented in firms. We characterize the work accomplished by
              compliance analysts who are in fact, ``curving'' the script of
              regulation within what we conceptualize as a ``comfort zone''.
              Beyond agency, ethics appears as a key element in linking the
              ``letter of the law'', which serves as a referential anchor to
              guide action, with the complex nature of specific situations. We
              analyze the way individuals and compliance teams cope with,
              interpret, struggle and in fine, perform regulation within this
              comfort zone. A particular interest is thus given to the work of
              embedded ethics in this process, as an enabler to partly recouple
              compliance with the regulated activity. We find that blind
              execution is not only impossible, but also devoid of meaning both
              from regulatory, risk management, and business perspectives in
              organizations. We highlight and characterize a hermeneutic
              dimension to this work, essential to effectively perform

               financial system. But collateral markets also have the potential
               to exacerbate risks to financial stability, not least given that
               during periods of market stress demand for high-quality
               collateral may increase, whilst collateral availability may
               fall. This paper offers a means to estimate how this potential
               imbalance between collateral supply and demand is likely to vary

               cause a dislocation in the market for collateral and a
               subsequent deterioration in market functioning. It suggests that
               --- from the perspective of financial stability --- the
               implications of an imbalance between the supply and demand of
               collateral are likely to be comparatively benign, but that the

               market participants to act as intermediaries in collateral

               Second, the responses to changes in macroprudential tools differ

              the European banking sector during the various stages of the
              Basel process of capital regulation. In the first part we
              document the evolution of various measures of systemic risk as
              the Basel process unfolds. Most strikingly, we find that the
              exposure to systemic risk as measured by SRISK has been steeply
              rising for the highest quintile, moderately rising for the second
              quintile and remaining roughly stationary for the remaining three
              quintiles of listed European banks. This observation suggests
              that the Basel process has succeeded in containing systemic risk
              for the majority of European banks but not for the largest
              institutions. In the second part we analyse the drivers of
              systemic risk. We find compelling evidence that the increase in
              exposure to systemic risk (SRISK) is intimately tied to the
              implementation of internal models for determining credit risk as
              well as market risk. Based on this evidence, the sub-prime crisis
              found especially the largest and more systemic banks ill-prepared
              and lacking resiliency. This condition has even aggravated during
              the European sovereign crisis. Banking Union has not (yet)

               that eschewing theory places on inference In this rigorous and
               well-crafted work, Kenneth Wolpin examines the role of theory in
               inferential empirical work in economics and the social sciences
               in general---that is, any research that uses raw data to go
               beyond the mere statement of fact or the tabulation of
               statistics. He considers in particular the limits that eschewing
               the use of theory places on inference.Wolpin finds that the
               absence of theory in inferential work that addresses
               microeconomic issues is pervasive. That theory is unnecessary
               for inference is exemplified by the expression ``let the data
               speak for themselves.'' This approach is often called ``reduced
               form.'' A more nuanced view is based on the use of experiments
               or quasi-experiments to draw inferences. Atheoretical approaches
               stand in contrast to what is known as the structuralist
               approach, which requires that a researcher specify an explicit
               model of economic behavior---that is, a theory. Wolpin offers a
               rigorous examination of both structuralist and nonstructuralist
               approaches. He first considers ex ante policy evaluation,
               highlighting the role of theory in the implementation of
               parametric and nonparametric estimation strategies. He
               illustrates these strategies with two examples, a wage tax and a
               school attendance subsidy, and summarizes the results from
               applications. He then presents a number of examples that
               illustrate the limits of inference without theory: the effect of
               unemployment benefits on unemployment duration; the effect of
               public welfare on women's labor market and demographic outcomes;
               the effect of school attainment on earnings; and a famous field
               experiment in education dealing with class size. Placing each
               example within the context of the broader literature, he
               contrasts them to recent work that relies on theory for
               inference.",

               There is a rationale for countercyclical capital requirements
               that impose lower capital demands when aggregate bank capital is
               low. However, such capital requirements also have a cost as they
               increase systemic risk taking: by insulating banks against
               aggregate shocks (but not bank-specific ones), they create
               incentives to invest in correlated activities. As a result, the
               economy's sensitivity to shocks increases and systemic crises

              on the relationship between competition and the absolute level of
              risk of individual banks, in this paper we examine the

              Examining the impact of the institutional and regulatory

              more fragile in countries with weak supervision and private

               inconsistent. To illustrate the severity of this issue, we
               randomly generate placebo laws in state-level data on female
               wages from the Current Population Survey. For each law, we use

              experts at the ECB and national central banks with narrative
              information on a broad range of instruments which are tracked
              over their life cycle. Using a dynamic panel framework at a
              monthly frequency enables us to assess the impact of
              macroprudential tools and their design on the banks' systemic
              risk both in the short and the long run. We furthermore decompose
              the systemic risk measure in an individual bank risk component
              and a systemic linkage component. This is of particular interest
              because microprudential policy focuses on the tail risk of an
              individual bank while macroprudential policy targets systemic
              risk by addressing the interlinkages and common exposures across
              banks. On average, all banks benefit from macroprudential tools
              in terms of their individual risk. We find that credit growth
              tools and exposure limits exhibit the most pronounced downward
              effect on the individual risk component. However, we find
              evidence for a risk-shifting effect which is more pronounced for
              retail-oriented banks. The effects are heterogeneous across banks
              with respect to the systemic linkage component. Liquidity tools
              and measures aimed at increasing the resilience of banks decrease
              the systemic linkage of banks. However, these tools appear to be
              most effective for distressed banks. Our results have

               that impose lower capital demands when aggregate bank capital is
               low. However, such capital requirements also have a cost as they
               increase systemic risk taking: by insulating banks against
               aggregate shocks (but not bank-specific ones), they create
               incentives to invest in correlated activities. As a result, the
               economy's sensitivity to shocks increases and systemic crises
               can become more likely. Capital requirements that directly
               incentivize banks to become less correlated dominate
               countercyclical policies as they reduce both systemic
               risk-taking and cyclicality.",

              ways through which banks have transferred credit risk in the
              financial system. We study the systematic risk of banks before
              the crisis, using two samples of banks respectively trading
              Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and issuing Collateralized Loan
              Obligations (CLOs). After their first usage of either risk
              transfer method, the share price beta of these banks increases
              significantly. This suggests the market anticipated the risks
              arising from these methods, long before the crisis. We
              additionally separate this beta effect into a volatility and a
              market correlation component. Quite strikingly, this
              decomposition shows that the increase in the beta is solely due
              to an increase in banks' correlations. Thus, while banks may have
              shed their individual credit risk, they actually posed greater
              systemic risk. This creates a challenge for financial regulation,
              which has typically focused on individual institutions.",

               points. First, from a normative perspective, the model defines
               the fundamental market failure to be addressed, namely, that
               unregulated private money creation can lead to an externality in
               which intermediaries issue too much short-term debt and leave
               the system excessively vulnerable to costly financial crises.
               Second, it shows how in a simple economy where commercial banks
               are the only lenders, conventional monetary policy tools such as
               open-market operations can be used to regulate this externality,
               whereas in more advanced economies it may be helpful to
               supplement monetary policy with other measures. Third, from a

               monetary policy can influence bank lending and real activity,

              policy to contain the systemic risk of European banks between
              2000 and 2017. We use a new database (MaPPED) collected by
              experts at the ECB and national central banks with narrative
              information on a broad range of instruments which are tracked
              over their life cycle. Using a dynamic panel framework at a
              monthly frequency enables us to assess the impact of
              macroprudential tools and their design on the banks' systemic
              risk both in the short and the long run. We furthermore decompose
              the systemic risk measure in an individual bank risk component
              and a systemic linkage component. This is of particular interest
              because microprudential policy focuses on the tail risk of an
              individual bank while macroprudential policy targets systemic
              risk by addressing the interlinkages and common exposures across
              banks. On average, all banks benefit from macroprudential tools
              in terms of their individual risk. We find that credit growth
              tools and exposure limits exhibit the most pronounced downward
              effect on the individual risk component. However, we find
              evidence for a risk-shifting effect which is more pronounced for
              retail-oriented banks. The effects are heterogeneous across banks
              with respect to the systemic linkage component. Liquidity tools
              and measures aimed at increasing the resilience of banks decrease
              the systemic linkage of banks. However, these tools appear to be
              most effective for distressed banks. Our results have

              However, our understanding of these policies and their efficacy

              macroprudential policies in 57 advanced and emerging economies
              covering the period from 2000:Q1 to 2013:Q4, with tightenings and

              the paper are: (1) Macroprudential policies have been used far
              more actively after the global financial crisis in both advanced
              and emerging economies. (2) These policies have primarily
              targeted the housing sector, especially in the advanced
              economies. (3) Macroprudential policies are usually changed in
              tandem with bank reserve requirements, capital flow restrictions,
              and monetary policy. (4) Our analysis suggests that
              macroprudential tightening is associated with lower bank credit
              growth, housing credit growth, and house price appreciation. (5)
              Targeted policies -- for example, those specifically intended to
              limit house price appreciation -- seem to be more effective,

              carefully studied. The first is similar to the traditional lasso
              estimator with only two tuning parameters (one for regression

              These tuning parameters can be easily calculated via a

               selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models
               like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge
               regression. There is also an interesting relationship with
               recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and
               Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in
               a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized

              data arises in a wide range of research areas from genomics,
              medical imaging to finance. Conventional methods for estimating
              the false discovery proportion (FDP) often ignore the effect of
              heavy-tailedness and the dependence structure among test
              statistics, and thus may lead to inefficient or even inconsistent
              estimation. Also, the commonly imposed joint normality assumption
              is arguably too stringent for many applications. To address these
              challenges, in this paper we propose a Factor-Adjusted Robust
              Multiple Testing (FarmTest) procedure for large-scale
              simultaneous inference with control of the false discovery
              proportion. We demonstrate that robust factor adjustments are
              extremely important in both controlling the FDP and improving the
              power. We identify general conditions under which the proposed
              method produces consistent estimate of the FDP. As a byproduct
              that is of independent interest, we establish an exponential-type
              deviation inequality for a robust U-type covariance estimator
              under the spectral norm. Extensive numerical experiments
              demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over several
              state-of-the-art methods especially when the data are generated
              from heavy-tailed distributions. The proposed procedures are
              implemented in the R-package FarmTest.",

              particular, to improve the prediction properties of the model and
              its sparse recovery ability, we consider a Group Lasso with a
              spike-and-slab prior. Penalty hyper-parameters governing the
              model shrinkage are automatically tuned via an adaptive MCMC

              contraction rate, and we show optimality of the posterior
              predictive density. Simulations show that the proposed models

                   frequently observed and increase the probability of large
                   losses affecting market participants' risk capital. Commonly
                   used risk management tools fail to account for potential
                   spillover effects among institutions because they provide
                   individual risk assessment. We contribute to analyse the

               attracted much research interest. In this paper, we propose
               adaptive Lasso quantile regression (BALQR) from a Bayesian
               perspective. The method extends the Bayesian Lasso quantile
               regression by allowing different penalization parameters for
               different regression coefficients. Inverse gamma prior
               distributions are placed on the penalty parameters. We treat the
               hyperparameters of the inverse gamma prior as unknowns and
               estimate them along with the other parameters. A Gibbs sampler
               is developed to simulate the parameters from the posterior
               distributions. Through simulation studies and analysis of a
               prostate cancer dataset, we compare the performance of the BALQR
