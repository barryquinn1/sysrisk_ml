  abstract  = "Most textbooks on regression focus on theory and the simplest of
               examples. Real statistical problems, however, are complex and
               subtle. This is not a book about the theory of regression. It is
               about using regression to solve real problems of comparison,
               estimation, prediction, and causal inference. Unlike other
               books, it focuses on practical issues such as sample size and
               missing data and a wide range of goals and techniques. It jumps
               right in to methods and computer code you can use immediately.
               Real examples, real stories from the authors' experience
               demonstrate what regression can do and its limitations, with
               practical advice for understanding assumptions and implementing
               methods for experiments and observational studies. They make a
               smooth transition to logistic regression and GLM. The emphasis
               is on computation in R and Stan rather than derivations, with
               code available online. Graphics and presentation aid
               understanding of the models and model fitting.",

              Stress (CISS). Its specific statistical design is shaped
              according to standard definitions of systemic risk. The main
              methodological innovation of the CISS is the application of basic
              portfolio theory to the aggregation of five market-specific
              subindices created from a total of 15 individual financial stress
              measures. The aggregation accordingly takes into account the
              time-varying cross-correlations between the subindices. As a
              result, the CISS puts relatively more weight on situations in
              which stress prevails in several market segments at the same
              time, capturing the idea that financial stress is more systemic
              and thus more dangerous for the economy as a whole if financial
              instability spreads more widely across the whole financial
              system. Applied to euro area data, we determine within a
              threshold VAR model a systemic crisis-level of the CISS at which
              financial stress tends to depress real economic activity.",

              power tend to take on lower credit risk and have a lower

              general, but for banks with market power this effect
              significantly weakens or can even be reversed. Higher activity

               of stock repurchase programs by large U.S. corporations in the
               late 1980s and early 1990s, when firms were experiencing
               external pressures to adopt policies that demonstrate corporate
               control over managerial behavior. We develop theory to explain
               variation in the responses of firms to such pressures, i.e., why
               some firms acquiesce by actually implementing stock repurchase
               programs, while others decouple formally adopted repurchase
               programs from actual corporate investments, so that the plans

                   investigate the consequence associated with the tail

                   frequently observed and increase the probability of large

                   used risk management tools fail to account for potential
                   spillover effects among institutions because they provide

                   estimation tool for evaluating the Conditional Value-at-Risk
                   (CoVaR) defined as the Value-at-Risk of an institution

               concentration limits, loan to value (LTV) ratio limits, and

  abstract = "The effective implementation of regulation in organizations is an
              ongoing concern for both research and practice, in order to avoid
              deviant behavior and its consequences. However, the way
              compliance with regulations is actually enacted or ``performed''
              within organizations instead of merely executed, remains largely
              under-characterized. Evidence from an ethnographic study in the
              compliance unit of a French investment bank allows us to develop
              a detailed practice approach to how regulation is actually
              implemented in firms. We characterize the work accomplished by
              compliance analysts who are in fact, ``curving'' the script of
              regulation within what we conceptualize as a ``comfort zone''.
              Beyond agency, ethics appears as a key element in linking the
              ``letter of the law'', which serves as a referential anchor to
              guide action, with the complex nature of specific situations. We
              analyze the way individuals and compliance teams cope with,
              interpret, struggle and in fine, perform regulation within this
              comfort zone. A particular interest is thus given to the work of
              embedded ethics in this process, as an enabler to partly recouple
              compliance with the regulated activity. We find that blind
              execution is not only impossible, but also devoid of meaning both
              from regulatory, risk management, and business perspectives in
              organizations. We highlight and characterize a hermeneutic
              dimension to this work, essential to effectively perform
              regulation in complex environments, and we suggest some
              directions for further research.",

  abstract  = "Collateral plays an important role in supporting a vast range of
               transactions that help ensure the efficient functioning of the
               financial system. But collateral markets also have the potential
               to exacerbate risks to financial stability, not least given that
               during periods of market stress demand for high-quality
               collateral may increase, whilst collateral availability may
               fall. This paper offers a means to estimate how this potential
               imbalance between collateral supply and demand is likely to vary
               as a function of market stress. In doing so, it offers an
               estimate of the increase in market volatility sufficient to
               cause a dislocation in the market for collateral and a
               subsequent deterioration in market functioning. It suggests that
               --- from the perspective of financial stability --- the
               implications of an imbalance between the supply and demand of
               collateral are likely to be comparatively benign, but that the
               implications of a reduction in the willingness and/or ability of
               market participants to act as intermediaries in collateral
               markets are likely to have more serious consequences for market
               functioning. This work also provides a framework through which

               affect the proximity of these risks.",

              the European banking sector during the various stages of the
              Basel process of capital regulation. In the first part we
              document the evolution of various measures of systemic risk as
              the Basel process unfolds. Most strikingly, we find that the
              exposure to systemic risk as measured by SRISK has been steeply
              rising for the highest quintile, moderately rising for the second
              quintile and remaining roughly stationary for the remaining three
              quintiles of listed European banks. This observation suggests
              that the Basel process has succeeded in containing systemic risk
              for the majority of European banks but not for the largest
              institutions. In the second part we analyse the drivers of
              systemic risk. We find compelling evidence that the increase in
              exposure to systemic risk (SRISK) is intimately tied to the
              implementation of internal models for determining credit risk as
              well as market risk. Based on this evidence, the sub-prime crisis
              found especially the largest and more systemic banks ill-prepared
              and lacking resiliency. This condition has even aggravated during
              the European sovereign crisis. Banking Union has not (yet)

              show a robust negative relationship between bank competition and
              systemic risk. Whereas much of the extant literature has focused
              on the relationship between competition and the absolute level of
              risk of individual banks, in this paper we examine the
              correlation in the risk taking behavior of banks. We find that
              greater competition encourages banks to take on more diversified
              risks, making the banking system less fragile to shocks.
              Examining the impact of the institutional and regulatory
              environment on bank systemic risk shows that banking systems are
              more fragile in countries with weak supervision and private
              monitoring, greater government ownership of banks, and with
              public policies that restrict competition. We also find that the

              experts at the ECB and national central banks with narrative
              information on a broad range of instruments which are tracked
              over their life cycle. Using a dynamic panel framework at a
              monthly frequency enables us to assess the impact of
              macroprudential tools and their design on the banks' systemic
              risk both in the short and the long run. We furthermore decompose
              the systemic risk measure in an individual bank risk component
              and a systemic linkage component. This is of particular interest
              because microprudential policy focuses on the tail risk of an
              individual bank while macroprudential policy targets systemic
              risk by addressing the interlinkages and common exposures across
              banks. On average, all banks benefit from macroprudential tools
              in terms of their individual risk. We find that credit growth

              closure policies also suffer from an implicit
              ``too-many-to-fail'' problem: when the number of bank failures is
              large, the regulator finds it ex-post optimal to bail out some or
              all failed banks, whereas when the number of bank failures is
              small, failed banks can be acquired by the surviving banks. This
              gives banks incentives to herd and increases the risk that many
              banks may fail together. The ex-post optimal regulation may thus
              be time-inconsistent or sub-optimal from an ex-ante standpoint.
              In contrast to the too-big-to-fail problem which mainly affects
              large banks, we show that the too-many-to-fail problem affects
              small banks more by giving them stronger incentives to herd.",

              ways through which banks have transferred credit risk in the
              financial system. We study the systematic risk of banks before
              the crisis, using two samples of banks respectively trading
              Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and issuing Collateralized Loan
              Obligations (CLOs). After their first usage of either risk
              transfer method, the share price beta of these banks increases
              significantly. This suggests the market anticipated the risks
              arising from these methods, long before the crisis. We
              additionally separate this beta effect into a volatility and a
              market correlation component. Quite strikingly, this
              decomposition shows that the increase in the beta is solely due
              to an increase in banks' correlations. Thus, while banks may have
              shed their individual credit risk, they actually posed greater
              systemic risk. This creates a challenge for financial regulation,

               points. First, from a normative perspective, the model defines
               the fundamental market failure to be addressed, namely, that
               unregulated private money creation can lead to an externality in
               which intermediaries issue too much short-term debt and leave
               the system excessively vulnerable to costly financial crises.
               Second, it shows how in a simple economy where commercial banks
               are the only lenders, conventional monetary policy tools such as
               open-market operations can be used to regulate this externality,

               supplement monetary policy with other measures. Third, from a

              policy to contain the systemic risk of European banks between
              2000 and 2017. We use a new database (MaPPED) collected by
              experts at the ECB and national central banks with narrative
              information on a broad range of instruments which are tracked
              over their life cycle. Using a dynamic panel framework at a
              monthly frequency enables us to assess the impact of
              macroprudential tools and their design on the banks' systemic
              risk both in the short and the long run. We furthermore decompose
              the systemic risk measure in an individual bank risk component
              and a systemic linkage component. This is of particular interest
              because microprudential policy focuses on the tail risk of an
              individual bank while macroprudential policy targets systemic
              risk by addressing the interlinkages and common exposures across
              banks. On average, all banks benefit from macroprudential tools
              in terms of their individual risk. We find that credit growth
              tools and exposure limits exhibit the most pronounced downward
              effect on the individual risk component. However, we find
              evidence for a risk-shifting effect which is more pronounced for

              the systemic linkage of banks. However, these tools appear to be
              most effective for distressed banks. Our results have

              macroprudential policies in 57 advanced and emerging economies
              covering the period from 2000:Q1 to 2013:Q4, with tightenings and

              the paper are: (1) Macroprudential policies have been used far
              more actively after the global financial crisis in both advanced
              and emerging economies. (2) These policies have primarily
              targeted the housing sector, especially in the advanced
              economies. (3) Macroprudential policies are usually changed in
              tandem with bank reserve requirements, capital flow restrictions,
              and monetary policy. (4) Our analysis suggests that
              macroprudential tightening is associated with lower bank credit
              growth, housing credit growth, and house price appreciation. (5)
              Targeted policies -- for example, those specifically intended to

              econometric and financial studies, we consider the case where
              covariate dependence can be reduced through the factor model, and
              propose a consistency strategy named Factor-Adjusted Regularized
              Model Selection (FarmSelect). By learning the latent factors and
              idiosyncratic components and using both of them as predictors,
              FarmSelect transforms the problem from model selection with
              highly correlated covariates to that with weakly correlated ones
              via lifting. Model selection consistency, as well as optimal
              rates of convergence, are obtained under mild conditions.
              Numerical studies demonstrate the nice finite sample performance
              in terms of both model selection and out-of-sample prediction.
              Moreover, our method is flexible in the sense that it pays no
              price for weakly correlated and uncorrelated cases. Our method is
              applicable to a wide range of high dimensional sparse regression
              problems. An R-package FarmSelect is also provided for

              autoregressive errors. Two types of lasso estimators are
              carefully studied. The first is similar to the traditional lasso
              estimator with only two tuning parameters (one for regression
              coefficients and the other for autoregression coefficients).
              These tuning parameters can be easily calculated via a

              fully efficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose a second
              lasso estimator which uses different tuning parameters for each

               The ?lasso? minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the
               sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a
               constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to
               produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives
               interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the

              the false discovery proportion (FDP) often ignore the effect of
              heavy-tailedness and the dependence structure among test
              statistics, and thus may lead to inefficient or even inconsistent
              estimation. Also, the commonly imposed joint normality assumption
              is arguably too stringent for many applications. To address these
              challenges, in this paper we propose a Factor-Adjusted Robust
              Multiple Testing (FarmTest) procedure for large-scale
              simultaneous inference with control of the false discovery
