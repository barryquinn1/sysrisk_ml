\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we contribute to the ongoing policy debate on the
resilience of financial institutions by assessing whether capital policy
actions in Europe contribute to systemic risk. Using a flexible Bayesian
framework, we estimate systemic risk and assess the multilevel effects
of capital policy actions across Europe. The framework produces a
hierarchy of systemic risk implications of capital policy actions for
each of the 21 European countries. We focus specifically on tightening,
loosening, and ambiguous policy actions in the data. Our results reveal
that the accumulation of tightening policy actions have the unintended
consequence of increasing system risk by between 1 and 10 quarterly
percentage points at the bank level. When evaluating the intra-national
posterior probability of the `random effects', banks in Greece, Ireland
and the United Kingdom seem to be driving this result. Our results
suggest capital adequacy regulation can have the unintended consequence
of increasing systemic risk. This involuntary association may result
from several systemically unimportant institutions becoming `systemic as
a herd' when investing in the same asset classes to comply with capital
rules.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Not since the Great Depression-era reforms has there been such sweeping
re-regulation of financial institutions and markets. Following the
global financial crisis of 2007-09, national regulators and
international bodies have promoted a series of reforms to foster
economic stability. Ten years on from the problem, regulators,
policymakers and industry participants are trying to assess the outcomes
of such reforms and the interplay of regulation, supervision and
financial stability. One of the key concerns is that individually
prudent behaviour of banks could amplify systemic risk. In particular,
regulators worry that reforms that aimed to restrict total balance sheet
risks, such as higher capital requirements and the introduction of
leverage ratio requirements under Basle III, could result in banks
becoming increasingly similar. Precisely due to prudential rules
encouraging an expansion into specific areas and individual assets. As a
result, while banks might be safer individually, they might also have
become ``systemic as a herd'', that is, susceptible to the same shocks,
which could, in turn, increase systemic risk. Despite its importance,
work on this topic is at a relatively early stage.

In this paper, we contribute to this debate by evaluating how European
banks' systemic risk contributions are affected by the build-up of
capital policy actions. We source the data on policy actions from the
\emph{Ma}cro\emph{P}rudential \emph{P}olicy \emph{E}valuation
\emph{D}atabase (MaPPED)\footnote{\url{https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/mapped.en.html}}
introduced by Budnik and Kleibl (2018). The MaPPED data captures the
``\emph{life-cycle}'' of policy instruments expected to impact the whole
banking system significantly. The database categorises instruments into
either genuinely macroprudential or essentially microprudential. It
tracks events of the evolution of eleven categories and 53 subcategories
of instruments. MaPPED uses a carefully designed questionnaire in
cooperation with experts from national central banks and supervisory
authorities of all EU member states. Nevertheless, survey information
only reflects whether laws are on the books, not to what extent they
affect the network-wide risk in practice.

Building on the \(\Delta CoVaR\) methods (Adrian and Brunnermeier 2016;
Brunnermeier, Rother, and Schnabel 2020), which allows us to study banks
as systemic \emph{risk inducers}, we employ a flexible two-stage
Bayesian empirical design. In stage one, we capture the complete
posterior distribution of extreme event risk by extended the methods of
Bernardi, Gayraud, and Petrella (2013). Specifically, to improve
accuracy, we use a Bayesian adaptive LASSO technique to regularise the
set of time-varying covariates that adjust for macro-level dynamics in
tail risk. Unlikely a standard LASSO, this model adapts each predictor
separately in terms of the optimal regularisation to improve accuracy
and stabilise predictions(Li, Xi, and Lin 2010; Gelman, Hill, and
Vehtari 2020). In stage two, we use a Bayesian hierarchical regression
model to disentangle policy action effects. This multilevel framework
exploits the natural nested structure of the data (repeated observations
of banks within countries), allowing different intercepts and slopes to
varying across countries and over time. When the number of banks per
country is small, only including group indicators in a least-squares
regression gives unacceptably noisy estimates. Our bayesian multilevel
regression, via a partial pooling approach, uses the variation in the
data to estimate prior distribution on the deviation of the intercepts
and slopes (Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020). The procedure is especially
appropriate when the critical variable of interest is at the country
level and where some groupings (countries) have only a few publicly
listed banks.

Our baseline results point to a positive link between the build-up of
tightening policy actions and systemic risk contribution one quarter on.
Our hierarchical model disentangles this effect and finds that banks in
Greece, Ireland and the UK seem to be driving this risk inducing
behaviour. Overall, the influence of policy actions on individual system
risk is weak, with banks in many countries showing little impact from
policy actions one quarter. Interestingly, our models allow us to
compare effect sizes and loosening policy actions have the strongish
relative impact\footnote{Typically they have a 13 basis point reduction
  in average quarter systemic risk for a one standard deviation move in
  the predictor}. However, the estimate is quite noisy, with a 95\%
credibility interval of {[}-0.139,0.141{]}.

This finding supports the fallacy of composition hypothesis (Embrechts
et al. 2001): capital regulation - based on a bank's own risk - can
unintentionally exacerbate systemic risk (Acharya 2009; Danielsson,
Shin, and Zigrand 2012; Embrechts et al. 2001; Gehrig and Iannino 2017).
As banks comply with minimum capital standards, they invest (herd) in
similar securities that are more likely to be associated with common
factors, especially in crisis time (Danielsson, Shin, and Zigrand 2012).

There is a body of theoretical research that has investigated why banks
herd. One hypothesis posits that banks seek safety in similarity; that
is, as banks become concerned about regulatory bailouts, they have
incentives to copy each other's behaviour as they seek to exploit the
``too many to fail'' guarantee (Acharya and Yorulmazer 2007; Vives
2014). Another strand of the literature argues that banks herd through
investment choices. As individual banks diversify, their asset
portfolios may increase, increasing the linkages between financial
institutions and ultimately increasing systemic risk. Allen, Babus, and
Carletti (2012) present a model in which asset commonality and
short-term bank debt interact to generate systemic risk.

Herding behaviour has also been studied on the liabilities side (Farhi
and Tirole 2012; Horváth and Wagner 2017; Segura and Suarez 2011; Stein
2012). Vives (2014) argues that well-intentioned regulation and
supervision can lead to unexpected risk enhancing consequences through
strategic complementarity. The empirical literature has also
investigated banks herding behaviour through the diversification channel
(Hirakata, Kido, and Thum 2017; Nijskens and Wagner 2011).

Our study also contributes to the literature on bank risk-taking and the
quality of regulation and supervision. Studies using the World Bank
surveys on bank regulations and oversight find laws that empower remote
monitoring, promote information disclosure, and create incentives for
private sector corporate control advocate sustainable banks' performance
and encourage stability(Barth, Caprio, and Levine 2001, 2004, 2006,
2008, 2012). Further work focusing on bank risk-taking finds mixed
results. Agoraki, Delis, and Pasiouras (2011) find that the direct
effect of market power reduces risk-taking in banks in Central and
Eastern Europe. However, risk-taking is decreased only when banks with
weak (strong) market power are exposed to more stringent capital
(activity restrictions) regulation. They find that official supervisory
authority has only a direct effect on bank risk. Klomp and Haan (2012)
construct multidimensional bank risk measures distilling 25 risk
indicators into two common factors. They see the relationship between
bank risk, regulation, and supervision depending on size, ownership
structure, and riskiness level. A few studies consider regulation,
supervision and system-wide risk. Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache (2011)
find that BCP compliance is not robustly associated with bank soundness,
estimated by a system-wide z-score. One shortcoming of this study is
that the authors' risk measure fails to capture systemic contribution at
the bank level, which in turn would not provide disaggregated
information on individual bank strategies (Delis and Staikouras 2011).
Gehrig and Iannino (2017) assess the Basel process of capital
regulation's financial stability using two risk measures that capture a
bank's contribution and exposure to systemic risk. Surprisingly, they
find evidence that the adoption of internal models of credit risk is
enhancing systemic risk. This effect is more pronounced in large
systemically critical European banks. Their results extended the finding
of unintended risk consequences of internal model-based regulation in
the German banking system (Behn, Haselmann, and Vig 2016). They provided
empirical evidence for Basel II endogenous systemic risk warnings of
(Embrechts et al. 2001).

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section II
presents the data collection process. Section III offers a practical
design and estimation process. Section IV provides a discussion of the
essential findings, and Section V concludes.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{Data}\label{data}}

We start with daily equity and macroeconomic state variable data from
Refinitiv Datastream for the four ICB financial sector industries,
banks, investment banks and brokerage, insurance and real estate for 21
European countries. Compustat Global provides quarterly balance sheet
data used to create bank-level predictors. The quarterly data only
include observations with a price to book ratio and leverage values in
the interval \([0,100]\). We further apply truncation to the maturity
mismatch variable at the 1st and 99th percentile. Finally, to ensure
meaningful risk estimation, only those institutions which have at least
two years of equity data are included in the sample. After data
cleansing, we have a total of 724 financial institutions in our (116
commercial banks, 238 investment banks, 284 real estate companies, and
66 are insurance firms). The sample period for the systemic risk
estimation is 1995:I-2015:IV. The central part of the estimation uses
daily data.

We source the data on policy actions from the
\emph{Ma}cro\emph{P}rudential \emph{P}olicy \emph{E}valuation
\emph{D}atabase (MaPPED)\footnote{\url{https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/research/working-papers/html/mapped.en.html}}
introduced by Budnik and Kleibl (2018). The data tracks events of the
evolution of eleven categories and 53 subcategories of instruments{]}
MaPPED was compiled using a carefully designed questionnaire, in
cooperation with experts from national central banks and supervisory
authorities of all EU member states. We focus on the minimum capital
requirements (hereafter MCR) policy actions in this database. To
investigate their relationship to systemic risk, we create a quarterly
sum of these policy actions categorised by their intended impact. There
are three categories of impact:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Policy loosening
\item
  Policy tightening
\item
  Other and ambiguous impact
\end{enumerate}

In line with Cerutti, Claessens, and Laeven (2017), we create a lagged
cumulative count of actions to capture the overall policy stance of the
regulators. This sum increases when the policy instrument is activated,
or there is a change in scope and decreases when they are deactivated.
Unlike previous studies, we do not impose a prior assumption on the
impact of the three categories. This numeration places a prior belief on
the expected sign of the action\footnote{Previous studies have signed
  policy actions in terms of their intended consequence. In this way,
  they construct a result rather than allow the data to provide evidence
  of any risk effect (Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey 2017, @Cerutti2016,
  @Meuleman2019)} which could like to bias regression inference.
Precisely, we capture the accumulated effect of each policy action using
a cumulative sum and hypothesis that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  An increasing number of tightening actions will reduce systemic risk
\item
  An increasing number of policy loosening actions will not affect
  systemic risk
\item
  We have no a priori hypothesis on an increasing number of ambiguous
  actions.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{\label{tab:mcr}Summary of minimum capital requirement actions}

\begin{tabular}[t]{ccc}
\toprule
Intended Impact & Count & Percentage\\
\midrule
Ambiguous & 56 & 25\\
Loosening & 12 & 5\\
Tightening & 155 & 70\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table 1 shows the quarterly frequency of minimum capital requirement
policy actions by the national central bank's intended impact. Policy
tightening is the dominant intention over the sample period, with 70\%
of the total actions, while actions which loosen policy are the least
frequent.

1 & 8 & 1 & 2 &  & Loosening\\
68 & 29 & 56 &  & 2 & Tightening\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

Table 2 we can further disentangle the three categories in terms of the
scope of the action. Of the 56 MCR actions categorised as ambiguous,
most are changes in the scope of an existing tool. Again, policy
tightening actions dominate, with the majority of actions being the
activation of a policy tool, then a change in scope, and finally a
change in the level of an existing policy. When disentangling the
specific descriptions of the 29 changes in the level of existing policy
tightening actions, the textual sentiment increases level tightness.
This latter observation indicates the extent of the aggressive attempts
to curb excessive risk-taking in European banking. Our fundamental
research question is to assess whether this ramping up of actions had
any unintended network consequences.

Figure 1 describes the evolution of the MCR policy actions over the
sample period. The bottom panel indicates some spikes in activity,
notably in 2007 Q1, 2014 Q1, and 2015 Q1. These activity spikes are
unsurprising given intital reactions to the crisis and the wave of
regulatory reform which swept through Europe in this period.

\section{Methodology}\label{meth}}

We use a Bayesian inference framework to estimate systemic risk and
investigate the impact of policy actions. In a dynamic setting, this
offers some benefits compared to classical panel estimators. In contrast
to traditional approaches, which treat group-levels parameters as
nuisance parameter to be removed, Bayesian methods allow group-level
estimates regularised to only include information that adds explanatory
power. Furthermore, they can be used to likely attenuation bias that is
known to be associated with policy action count data Akinci and
Olmstead-Rumsey (2017). Finally, they can include a noise component with
incorporates the panel structure of the data.

\hypertarget{systemic-risk-measurement}{%
\subsection{Systemic risk measurement}\label{systemic-risk-measurement}}

We use the \(CoVaR\) approach to systemic risk contribution estimation,
which extends the Value at Risk (VaR) concept to the system. CoVaR can
be thought of as the VaR of the whole system conditional on institution
i being in a certain state. Systemic risk is approximated using
\(\Delta CoVaR\); the difference between the \(CoVaR\) conditional on
the distress of an institution and the CoVaR conditional on the median
state of that institution. \(\Delta CoVaR\) is best thought of as a
reduced form statistical tool which captures tail codependency or the
part of systemic risk that co-moves with the distress of an institution.
\(\Delta CoVaR\) frames a bank as a \emph{risk inducer}, quantifying the
contribution of a financial institution to the system's level of
systemic risk. This is achieved by estimating the additional value at
risk of the entire financial system associated with this institution
experiencing distress (Brunnermeier, Rother, and Schnabel 2020).

Formally, Let \((Y_1,\dots,Y_d)\) be a d-dimensional random vector where
each \(Y_j\) is expressed through some covariates
\(X= (X_1,X_2,...,X_M)\). In the systemic risk context, \(Y_j\) denotes
the behaviour of either an institutions or the whole system. Without
loss of generality, thereafter, we fix \(\tau \in (0,1)\) and suppose
that we are interested in institutions j within system k. The
Value-at-Risk, \(VaR^{\bf{X},\tau}_j\) of institution j is the
\(\tau\)-th level conditional quantile of the random variable
\(Y_j|\bf{X}=x\):

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq1}
\mathbb{P}(Y_j \leq VaR^{\bf{X},\tau}_j |\bf{X}=x)=\tau
\end{equation}

.The Conditional Value-at-Risk
\(\left( CoVaR_{system=k|j}^{\bf{X},\tau} \right)\)is the Value-at-Risk
of system k conditional on \(Y_j= VaR_j^{\bf{X}\tau}\) at the level
\(\tau\) which satisfies:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq2}
\mathbb{P}\left(Y_{system=k} \leq CoVaR_{system=k|j}^{\bf{X},\tau} |\bf{X}=x,Y_j=VaR^{\bf{X},\tau}_j \right)=\tau
\end{equation}

Using Bayesian inference, equation \ref{eq:eq2} implies that CoVaR
corresponds to the \(\tau\)-th percentile of the conditional
distribution (For a detailed exposition see Bernardi, Gayraud, and
Petrella 2013)

\hypertarget{bayesian-regularised-time-varying-delta-covar-estimation}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Bayesian regularised time-varying
\(\Delta CoVaR\)
estimation}{Bayesian regularised time-varying \textbackslash Delta CoVaR estimation}}\label{bayesian-regularised-time-varying-delta-covar-estimation}}

To capture all forms of risk including volatility feedback, adverse
asset price movements and funding liquidity risk, we estimate
\(\Delta CoVaR\) using daily return losses from 1995:I to 2018:IV for a
sample of European commercial banks, investment banks, insurance
companies and real estate companies. Return losses \(Y_{it}\) are
measured using market equity \(ME\) of the publicly traded institution,

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq3}
Y_{i,t+1}=-log(ME_{i,t+1}/ME_{i,t})
\end{equation}

We extend the work of Bernardi, Gayraud, and Petrella (2013) by using an
Bayesian adaptive LASSO quantile regression to evaluate daily time
varying \(\Delta CoVaR\). Regularisation techniques, such as the LASSO,
have been shown to improve predictive accuracy of quantile regression by
only include information which adds to the predictive power of the
explanatory variable set (Li, Xi, and Lin 2010). Regularisation
techniques employed with Bayesian inference are increasing common in
financial econometric (See for example Tibshirani 2011; Mogliani and
Simoni 2020; Fan, Ke, and Wang 2020). The adaptive LASSO is especially
useful when estimated time-varying \(\Delta CoVaR\), given the set of
state variables used to adjust for macro-level risk dynamics (See Table
A.1 for full list). Finally, in the context of systemic risk, Bayesian
methods are highly flexible and are extreme useful in the context of the
analysis of interdependence effects of extreme market events. Using data
and prior information they provide the complete posterior distribution
of the parameters of interest. Since the quantities of interest in this
paper are risk measures, learning about the whole distribution becomes
more relevant due to the interpretation of \(CoVaR\) as financial losses
(Bernardi, Gayraud, and Petrella 2013)

Formally, the Bayesian Adaptive Lasso regression is a hierarchical model
which exploits a skewed Laplace distribution\footnote{which has the
  attractive property of being represented as a scale mixture of normal
  distributions (Tsionas 2003)} to estimated \(VaR^{\bf{X},\tau}_j\) and
\(\left( CoVaR_{system=k|j}^{\bf{X},\tau} \right)\) as follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq4}
Y_{jt}=\beta_{0,j}+\bf{M^{'}_{i,t-1}} \bf{\beta_j} +\theta_j z_j+\phi \xi_j \sqrt{\sigma^{-1}z_j} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq5}
Y_{kt}=\beta_{0k}+\bf{M^{'}_{i,t-1}} \bf{\beta_k} +\delta Y_{jt}+\theta z_j+\phi\xi_k\sqrt{\sigma^{-1}z_k}
\end{equation}

where \(M\) is a set of European financial and macroeconomic variables
detailed in Table A.1 in the appendix.

\hypertarget{var-and-covar-posterior-estimation}{%
\subsubsection{VaR and CoVaR posterior
estimation}\label{var-and-covar-posterior-estimation}}

In the Bayesian inference, we capture the more intuitive probability of
the parameter estimates learned from the data\footnote{There is no free
  lunch, and bayesian inference comes at the cost of some additional
  assumptions, named priors. Our analysis interrogated these assumptions
  using prior predictive checks. Given that Bayesian models are
  generative, prior predictive checks allow the use of a range of
  informative and non-informative priors to generate simulated data that
  can be checked against the actual data. This process is robust and is
  not subject to information leakage as in certain data dredging
  frequentist practices}. Conventionally, posterior probabilities using
a maximum of the posterior density (Maximum a Posteriori or
\(MaP\))\footnote{MaPs are mathematically equivalent to the minimisation
  problem in the frequentist context (Lin and Chang 2012)} as a summary.
We assume an asymmetric Laplace distribution for the error terms and
weakly informative priors on the regressor parameters\footnote{Prior
  predictive checks show that the size of the dataset quick dominants
  any undue influence of these priors and is available upon request from
  the author}. From all the \(MaP\) parameters involved in the marginal
and conditional quantiles the estimates of \(VaR^{\bf{X},\tau}_j\) and
\(\left( CoVaR_{system=k|j}^{\bf{X},\tau} \right)\) are derived as
follows:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq6}
(VaR^{X,\tau}_j)^{MaP} = X^{'}\beta_j^{MaP}
\end{equation} \begin{equation}\label{eq:eq7}
(CoVaR_{system=k|j}^{X^{'},\tau})^{MaP} = X^{'} \beta_{system=k}^{MaP}+\delta^{MaP}(VaR^{\bf{X},\tau}_j)^{MaP}
\end{equation}

Figure 2 visualised the Bayesian quantile adaptive \(L1\) regularised
estimate for a selection of banks. In each plot the credibility set is
represented by the shaded area and represents the uncertainty in each
MaP estimate. The x-axis is a daily time indicator for the sample
period. The plots summarise of these MaP estimates and their 99\%
credible sets for a number of the banks in the sample. The shaded grey
area characterises the uncertainty around the MaP estimate. While the
time patterns are similar in each plot with a spike at the height of the
European crisis, both KBC group and National Bank of Greece stand out
for their significantly higher systemic risk inducing behaviour.

\hypertarget{bayesian-hierarchical-model}{%
\subsection{Bayesian Hierarchical
Model}\label{bayesian-hierarchical-model}}

This section will lay out the Bayesian hierarchical model to investigate
systemic risk implications of capital actions in Europe. Bayesian
hierarchical or multilevel models exploit a data structure with several
levels that are either nested or non-nested. The key to identifying a
variable as a level is that its units are a random sample from a wider
population. In this instance, we have a three-level nested data
structure of repeat observations within banks within European countries.
The banks are a random sample from a broader population of banks;
likewise, the countries are a random sample from many countries. In
general, multilevel models are helpful where relationships vary across
higher-level units\footnote{As a rule of thumb, the highest level should
  have at least 20 units to be suitable for this type of analysis
  (\url{http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/learning/multilevel-models/data-structures.html})}.
This is in stark contrast to classical least squares regression models
where group effects are typically binary indicators, so-called
\emph{fixed effects} models. Typically, a \emph{fixed effects} model
cannot discriminate between observed and unobserved group characteristic
effects (for example, a policy action applied by the national
regulator).\footnote{Econometrically, there is a confounding effect of
  the group level dummies on the group-level predictors} What results
from a fixed effect model is, at best, a partial estimate of the ground
truth. To date, there are some notable exceptions in panel data
econometrics to this (see, for example, Wooldridge (2019)). There is no
such issue with a multilevel model, where full effects at many levels
can be simultaneously estimated.

\hypertarget{multilevels-delta-covar-regressions}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Multilevels \(\Delta CoVaR\)
Regressions}{Multilevels \textbackslash Delta CoVaR Regressions}}\label{multilevels-delta-covar-regressions}}

The regression models use MaP estimates of \(\Delta CoVaR\) for the 116
commercial banks as the dependent variable. Our hierarchical regression
model aims to extract meaningful effects of country-level policy actions
on bank-level system risk levels. Our strategy allows for (bank-level)
coefficients on the policy action variables to vary by country and
quarter, in addition to being `fixed'. We can think of these then as our
three \emph{random effects}. Denoting \(y_{c,t[i]}\) as the
\(\widehat{CoVaR_{c,t[i]}}\) estimate of firm \(i\) in-country in time
t, we set up two specifications. A baseline where we assume that policy
action effect across countries is constant. Then we relax this
assumption allowing banks in each country to experience their effect,
which is then regularised, via partial pooling, by the global mean
effect. Equation \ref{eq:eq8} describes our baseline model (regression
1), while \ref{eq:eq9} describes the more country-level \emph{random
effects} model (regression 2).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq8}
 y_{c,t[i]} = (\alpha + \alpha_{c,t}) + \beta^L loose_{c,t}+\beta^T tight_{c,t}+\beta^A ambig_{c,t}+Bank_Adjustments_{c,t[i]}+M_{c,t}+\epsilon_{c,t[i]}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:eq9}
y_{c,t[i]} = (\alpha + \alpha_{c,t}) + (\beta^L+\beta^L_{c,t})loose_{c,t}+(\beta^T+\beta^T_{c,t})tight_{c,t} \\
  +(\beta^A+\beta^A_{c,t})ambig_{c,t}++Bank_Adjustments_{c,t[i]}+M_{c,t}+\epsilon
\end{equation}

\(\alpha, \beta^L, \beta^T\) and \(\beta_A\) are the `fixed' effect
population coefficients that represent the global `average' intercept
and globe slope coefficients our policy actions variables for a total
pooled sample. \(\beta^L_{c,t},\beta^T_{c,t},\beta^A_{c,t}\) are the
`random' effects counterparts and represent the slope coefficients for
each of the 22 countries \(c\) and 83 quarters \(t\). The ``random''
policy effect coefficient estimates, for each country or year, deviates
from the population average; such that \(\beta^T_{c,t}\) describes how
the systemic risk impact of tightening policy actions in the country
\(c\) or year \(t\) deviates from the average impact across taken all
countries and quarters. Following Brunnermeier, Rother, and Schnabel
(2020), we use a concise set of bank-level and macro-level
adjustments\footnote{The common practice use of \emph{control} when
  describing the adjudicating variables in a regression implies
  overconfidence in the analyst's ability and is sloppy statistical
  language. The true meaning of a \emph{control} variables is when we
  can intervene and change the variable by a certain amount, which is
  clearly not possible in any observational studies. We, therefore,
  prefer the more modest and realistic \emph{adjusting} description}.
The bank-level variables include (i) leverage, measured as the ratio of
total assets to common equity; (ii) maturity mismatch, measured as
short-term borrowings to total assets; (iii) size, measured as the log
of market equity, (iv) loan growth measures as the percentage change in
gross loans, and (v) an asset price boom indicator, which is the number
of consecutive quarters of being in the top decile of the price to book
ratio across all firms. The macro-level variable set \(M\) is the same
as that used in the time-varying systemic risk estimation. Finally, we
include an AR(1) error process to adjust for the panel nature of our
data, which are excluded from the already crowded specification above.

\hypertarget{robustness-checks}{%
\subsection{Robustness checks}\label{robustness-checks}}

By its theoretical nature systemic risk, and its joint distribution with
policy actions is a tail risk phenomenon, and capturing this feature in
the conditional distribution of our hierarchical regression may require
more nuance distributional assumes than normality. To this end, we
consider three alternative probability distributions, skewed-normal,
t-distribution and log-normal. Widely accepted information criteria
suggest that the t-distribution is the most appropriate among these
alternatives, which conforms with expert advice for modelling extreme
events in hierarchical models (Gelman et al. (2019)). The reported
results are those based on a t-distribution. Furthermore, attenuation
bias is a known issue when assessing the impact of country-level policy
actions on individual banks (Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey 2017). The
flexibility of our Bayesian framework allows us to adjust for this
measurement error using a latent variable set up. The results using a
measurement error model are qualitatively similar to the reported
estimates and are available upon request.

Table 3 and 4 present regression results for our baseline and multilevel
models. The baseline model assumes policy actions effects are constant
over time and across the country. Predictors are standardised. For
brevity, Bank-level covariate posterior probability not shown in the
baseline model. In both instances, the Bayesian \(R^2\) indicates the
model \emph{fit}\footnote{We follow the procedure outline in Gelman et
  al. (2019), which calculates the Bayesian Bayesian \(R^2\) as the
  variance of the predicted values divided by the variance of the
  predicted values plus the expected variance of the errors} is very
good. For the baseline model Bayesian \(R^2\) lies between
\([0.781,0,793]\) and for the multilevel model lies between
\([0.885,0.891]\) for the 95\% credible interval. Both models allow the
effects to be correlated, but we have not reported them in this table as
they are not significant. The results are stable to the use of different
priors and likelihoods.\footnote{Fixed effect coefficients are almost
  identical, while some non-critical variation in the random effects
  occurs. The Bayesian \(R^2\) for the normal likelihood is smaller than
  the student-t by around 9\%-13\%}.

Several initial findings are noteworthy. There is a statistically
credible positive link between the build-up of tightening policy actions
and systemic risk one quarter on. Specifically our baseline model
estimates a global random effect of 0.058 with a 95\% posterior credible
interval of {[}0.011,0.105{]}. The estimates of equation \ref{eq:eq8}
provide a more complex set of outputs (this model has 473 parameters)
which are best-summarised visually\footnote{The direct frequentist
  counterpart to this model is a mixed effect model estimated by
  maximising a multivariate normal likelihood. Technically, these models
  treat group-level parameter estimates as a random variable that
  marginalises out to become part of the error term. Traditional
  ``fixed-effects'' panel data analytics perform a similar operation to
  remove group-level parameters. However, the group-level effects cannot
  be recovered, meaning the model coefficient represent a partial effect
  that ignores group-level covariance.}

Figures 5-7 disentangle the pooled effects of the baseline model into
random effects at the country level. Specifically, they capture the
systemic risk implications one quarter on the build-up of policy
tightening, loosening and ambiguous actions, respectively. The
tightening policy actions effects for individual nations reveal that
Greek, Irish, and UK banks appear to be the driving force. The 99\%
credible intervals in each of these countries are statistically
meaningful. More generally, the effect of MCR policy actions on
individual system risk is weak, with banks in many countries showing
little impact from policy actions one quarter on. Interestingly, our
models allow us to compare effect sizes and loosening policy actions
have the strongish relative impact (-0.13 average reduction on quarterly
systemic risk for a one standard deviation move in the predictor).
However, the estimate is quite noisy with a credibility interval of
{[}-0.139,0.141{]}.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

The global financial crisis highlighted how losses at individual
financial institutions could spread across the financial system, giving
rise to systemic risk, and underscored the importance of regulation and
supervision to a well-functioning banking system. This paper assesses
the contribution of European capital adequacy policy actions to a bank's
system-wide risk. We focus on the MaPPED database of European policy
actions. The sample offers a detailed overview of the ``life-cycle'' of
policy instruments that are either genuinely macroprudential or
essentially microprudential but likely to impact the whole banking
system significantly. To hone in on our hypothesis question, we consider
the subcategory of minimum capital requirement policy actions and use a
flexible Bayesian hierarchical model to identify precise effects of
these policy actions on systemic risk measured using Bayesian
\(\Delta CoVaR\). The MaP estimates from the posterior probabilities are
then used in the hierarchical regressions to investigate the capital
policy action impact.

Overall, our results point to a positive link between the build-up of
tightening policy actions and systemic risk one quarter on. Specifically
our baseline model estimates a global random effect of 0.058 with a 95\%
posterior credible interval of {[}0.011,0.105{]}. Our hierarchical model
disentangles this result, suggesting that banks in Greece, Ireland and
the UK seem to be driving this effect. Overall, the MCR policy actions
have a weak effect on systemic risk, with banks in many countries
showing little impact from policy actions one quarter. Interestingly,
our models allow us to compare effect sizes and loosening policy actions
have the strongish relative impact (-0.13 reduction in average quarter
systemic risk for a one standard deviation move in the predictor).
However, the estimate is quite noisy with a credibility interval of
{[}-0.139,0.141{]}.

Systemic risk can emanate from large institutions which are highly
interconnected, but importantly, several smaller institutions may be
systemic as a herd. We argue that banks tend to choose correlated risks
during periods of increasing regulatory pressure and compliance
constraints and invest in correlated assets. This choice could increase
`herding'' as bank managers must benchmark themselves to regulatory
imposed industry standards. This type of market inefficiency could
increase rather than decrease systemic risk.
